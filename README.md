## AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS AND SAFETY PREDICTION PROJECT
The aim of this project is to provide insights that will improve aircraft operations and safety

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
### Problem Statement
Improving aircraft operations and safety by identifying potentional risks factors in accident data

## KEY BUSINESS QUESTIONS
1. Which aircraft models have a higher accident rate

2. What is the frequency of accident rates over time

3. Which geographical areas have the highest accident rates

4. How do the weather conditions contribute to accident rates

## OBJECTIVES
Identify aircarft models with the highest accident rate
Analyse and compare the severity of accidents in different weather conditions
Identify accident and incident rate patterns over the years
Analyse the geographical contribution to aviation accidents and incdents

## DATA UNDERSTANDING
Data Source
This dataset used is the Aviation Accident Database and Synopses, up to 2023 from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses The dataset contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, it's territories and possessions, and in international waters

## DATA PREPARATION
Handling missing values
Since we are working with a large dataset we will need to drop unnecessary columns and handle missing values. We also have to fix the naming of the certain columns with wrong naming conventions.

## DATA ANALYSIS
We will carry out exploratory data analysis for the cleaned data. This will allow us to find patterns within attributes through visualisations.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
Businesses should consider purchasing aircrafts with the least amount of accidents. Aircrafts with the least amount of accidents are built with improved technology over the years.
When purchasing an aircraft it is wise to consider more recent aircraft models as opposed to older models over the years
The United States is a vialble place to fly aircrafts since it has the highest aircraft activity compared to other countries

## CONCLUSIONS
When considering what aircraft model to purchase you should consider the safety rates of all the aicraft models to avoid making losses. The aircraft models that have good aviation technology are Airbus Indusrie, AIRBUS, Mcdonell Douglas and PIPER
